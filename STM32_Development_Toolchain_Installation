This installation procedure was performed on Linux Mint Rose 17.3

1. Insure Java version 1.8 is installed on the machine

2. If not run the following commands to add a repository to the offical Oracle development of JAVA 8 

Optional: Remove the current OpenJDK that is installed with every Mint distro
	sudo apt-get remove opdenjdk*

Required: Commands to add repository to offical Oracle development
	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer

Check to see what version of java is installed "java -version", this must be above 1.8 for eclipse-neon(or current version) to work

3. Download the latest verion of eclipse with the built in installer. This is for Neon 64bit and it should be a tar.gz file format
https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/oomph/epp/neon/R/eclipse-inst-linux64.tar.gz&mirror_id=272

	Navigate to the downloaded .tar.gz file
	Extract it using "tar -zxvf name-of-file.tar.gz"
	Navigate through the extracted files and run the "eclipse-inst" executable. In terminal its "./eclipse-inst"
	An installer window should appear.
		For STM32 you need C/C++ eclipse
		Note: If a box is prompting for the location for "Java VM 1.8+" the installer cannot find where Java8 is installed

4. Open Eclipse and install "System Workbench for STM32" (This is a development package addon which will give us the tools we need to program and debug STMicroelectronic hardware)

	Start by opening "Help>>Install New Software", This opens "Available Software" dialog
	Click the "Add" button at the top right corner
	Under name: "System Workbench for STM32 - Bare Machine edition"
	Under Location: http://www.openstm32.org/Eclipse-updates/org.openstm32.system-workbench.site
	Install all the tools it prompts for and restart eclipse when asked

	Note: If any of this fails or the links are broken find this information on "openstm32.org" everything is free, don't worry 
		if you have to create an account.

5. STLink driver
	
	For linux debian systems the ST-Link/V2-1 is supported by libusb (which is natively installed on the system) however the 
	device needs a special name with a "udev" rule

	A. Download is tarball containing 49-stlinkv2.rule
		http://www.openstm32.org/dl160
	B. Extract the tarball into /etc/udev/rules.d under root permission using
		sudo tar -xf stlink_udev_rule.tar.bz2 -C /etc/udev/rules.d

	NOTE: If these links are broken, again find this information at openstm32.org or more specifically
		http://www.openstm32.org/Installing+System+Workbench+for+STM32+from+Eclipse 
		the link above contains all the information above, listing how to install the System Workbench Software. STLink driver

	Finally: Install 32-bit binaries and ncurses5. The eclipse program might run properly without this step. I haven't tested it
		sudo apt-get install lib32ncurses5


This should be everything needed to build STM32 projects and burn them to the microcontroller in eclipse

You can start a project from scratch "File>>New>>C/C++ Project", but ensure you are using the "Ac6 STM32 MCU GCC toolchain"
